Deep learning introduction:
1,Deep learning is defines about to working on complex neural network.This topic is subset of the machine learning.
types od layers in deep learning:

1.input layer:
receive the raw data to the machine

2.hidden layer:
perform the computation in the hidden layer which is process the data

3.output layer:
provide the final output and prediction on classification 

Activation function in deep learning:

1.ReLu : Reactfield liner unit:
which is used to hidden layer to slow the data in the gradient of the data .which is tye simple used to speed up during the training of the data .
2.sigmoid:
map the value binary(0 and 1 in the layer).
3. softmax:
convert the raw data in to (score) convert into the probability on the givendata.

back prepogation and optimisation :
in this prepogarion step we use some of the example  : mse"(means stander error),cross stop : which are optimises the
